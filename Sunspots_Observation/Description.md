# Description - Sunspots_Observation

Datasource = https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhinand05/daily-sun-spot-data-1818-to-2019/code?select=sunspot_data.csv
---
This project is based on sunspots observation data, from 1818 to 2019, obtained at Kaggle. With the help of Pandas, Numpy and MatPlotLib, i cleanned the data and retrieved some information.

I aimed to clean the data, as some dates had missing values.

With the cleanned data, i retrieved the values of observations/year, plotted and interpolated a curve for further analysis.
Also, i retrieved important information:
- Year with largest number of observations;
- Date at which the largest number of sunspots where observed.

The project and the data is available at the folder. Thanks :)
