# Description - Sunspots Observation Data

This project is based on sunspots observation data, from 1818 to 2019, obtained at Kaggle. With Python 3 and With the help of Pandas, Numpy and MatPlotLib, i cleanned the data and retrieved some information.

I aimed to clean the data, as some information is missing. Values of -1 for the column "Number of sunspots" represents missing values, which were discarted.
With the cleanned data, i retrieved the values of observations/year, plotted and interpolated a curve for further analysis.
Also, i retrieved important information:

- Year with largest number of observations (2018);
- Finding the existence of solar cycles of 11 years, in which the number os sunspots hit a peak;
- Date at which the largest number of sunspots where observed (26/08/1870  -  528 sunspots);
- Last Sun's cycle peak (2014);
- Prevision of the next peak (2025).

The project and the data is available at the folder. Thank you!
